# Apache Web-Server
This folder contains the files for the Apache (PHP) Web-server. It also contains the front-end for
customers of American Airlines to verify that they checked into the airport.

# Contributors
The web-server was primarily programmed by Michael Kasman, and some of the PHP server scripts
were also created by Pravat Bhusal.
